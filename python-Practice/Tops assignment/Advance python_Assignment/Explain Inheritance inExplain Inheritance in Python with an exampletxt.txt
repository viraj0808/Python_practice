Explain Inheritance in Python with an example?
--Inheritance relationship defines the classes that inherit from other classes as derived, subclass, or sub-type classes.
  Base class remains to be the source from which a subclass inherits. 
  For example, you have a Base class of “Animal,” and a “Lion” is a Derived class. 
  The inheritance will be Lion is an Animal.
What is init? Or What Is A Constructor In Python?
----The Default __init__ Constructor in C++ and Java. Constructors are used to initializing the object’s state.
    The task of constructors is to initialize(assign values) to the data members of the class when an object of the class is created. 
    methods, a constructor also contains a collection of statements(i.e. instructions) that are executed at the time of Object creation.
    is run as soon as an object of a class is instantiated.
    The method is useful to do any initialization you want to do with your object.
